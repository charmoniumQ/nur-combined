# Wasabi375 nix package repository

This includes packages by me and some third party software that I packaged,
mostyl for my use.

## Build package

Before updating the repository make sure all packages can be build.
To build a package locally use `nix build .#<packagename>`, 
e.g `nix build .#procrastinate`
